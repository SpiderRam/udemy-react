## useState vs. useReducer

There is no hard rule or clear wrong or right about when to use one or the other. But in general, you need to use `useReducer` if `useState` has become cumbersome or you're getting a lot of bugs or unintended behaviors.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
| `useState` | `useReducer` |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| The primary state management tool. | Great if you need more 'power'. |
| Great for independent pieces of state/data. | Ideal when you have related pieces of state/data. |
| Great if state updates are easy and limited to a few kinds of updates. | Helpful when you have more complex state updates |
